# Using Ufind with a Mysql database

Using `Ufind` for searching in a database is easy, because accessing a
database is naturally well adapted to constructing a sequence
(`Seq.t`); and any sequence can be directly used by `Ufind`.

In this file we give an example with the `mysql` package

```
opam install mysql
```

but adapting to other types of databases should be quite obvious.

## First use the database capabilities

A database is _meant_ for very quick searching in very large sets of
data.  So, the first thing to do is to _narrow your search_ first, by
executing a relevent query. On the other hand, databases are not
always very good at handling Unicode encodings and searching, this is
where `Ufind` enters the picture, but _only as a second step_.

## The world database

For this example, we use the freely available 'world' database

https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/world.sql.gz

Once you have downloaded it, connect to Mysql and insert the file as follows:

```
mysql> SHOW tables;
+-----------------+
| Tables_in_world |
+-----------------+
| city            |
| country         |
| countrylanguage |
+-----------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

This table has the following structure:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM city LIMIT 5;
+----+----------------+-------------+---------------+------------+
| ID | Name           | CountryCode | District      | Population |
+----+----------------+-------------+---------------+------------+
|  1 | Kabul          | AFG         | Kabol         |    1780000 |
|  2 | Qandahar       | AFG         | Qandahar      |     237500 |
|  3 | Herat          | AFG         | Herat         |     186800 |
|  4 | Mazar-e-Sharif | AFG         | Balkh         |     127800 |
|  5 | Amsterdam      | NLD         | Noord-Holland |     731200 |
+----+----------------+-------------+---------------+------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## Ufind_mysql: 1. create a sequence of search items

The `world` function connects to mysql and gives you a handle to the
`world` database.

Then the `world_items` function returns a sequence of search items,
where the search field is the `Name` of the city, and the data we want
to return is a string including the `Name` field but also the
`CountryCode` field, in the form "City: Paris, Country code: [FRA]".


```ocaml
#require "mysql";;
#require "seq";;
#require "ufind";;

open Printf;;
open Mysql;;

let default o x = match o with
  | None -> x
  | Some y -> y
    
let world_items db =
  let res = exec db "SELECT * FROM city" in
  let () = match status db with
    | StatusError _ ->
      print_endline ("Error when processing Mysql query. " ^
                     (default (errmsg db) "?"))
    | StatusOK
    | StatusEmpty -> () in
  let get_name row = (default (column ~key:"Name" ~row res)) "Unknown"
                     |> Ufind.isolatin_to_utf8 in
  let get_code row = default (column ~key:"CountryCode" ~row res) "???" in
  let get_data row = sprintf "City: %s, Country code: [%s]"
      (get_name row) (get_code row) in
  let rec seq () = match fetch res with
    | None -> Seq.empty
    | Some row -> fun () -> Seq.Cons (row, seq ()) in
  Ufind.items_from_seq ~get_name ~get_data (seq ());;
  
let world () =
  quick_connect ~database:"world" ~user:"san" ~password:"sanette"  ()
```

## Ufind_mysql 2. Searching

Two possibilies:

1. each search starts with a Mysql query

2. we load into memory the list of search items, and then each search
does not rely on the Mysql connection anymore.

```ocaml
 let test () =
  let db = world () in

(* 1. With Mysql queries *)

  print_endline "\nLooking for 'paris' through a Mysql query:";
  let items = world_items db in
  let paris = Ufind.select_data items "paris" in
  List.iter print_endline paris;

  print_endline "\nLooking for 'río' through a Mysql query:";
  let items = world_items db in
  let rio = Ufind.select_data items "río" in
  List.iter print_endline rio;

(* 2. No Mysql connection required *)

  print_endline "\nPreprocessing the whole database in memory.";
  let pitems = Ufind.seq_eval (world_items db) in

  print_endline "\nLooking for 'paris':";
  let paris = Ufind.select_data pitems "paris" in
  List.iter print_endline paris;

  print_endline "\nLooking for 'río':";
  let rio = Ufind.select_data pitems "río" in
  List.iter print_endline rio;;

```

Here is the result:

```

City: Paris, Country code: [FRA]

City: Ríobamba, Country code: [ECU]
