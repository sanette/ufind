(** Case insensitive, accent insensitive search engine

Ufind is a small library that provides a case insentitive, accent insensitive
   search in strings encoded in utf8. It is meant to be easy to use, either for
   searching simple lists, or for digging in large databases.

 Thanks to {{:https://sanette.github.io/ubase/}Ubase}, accents and more general
   diacritics are recognized for all Latin characters.  For other
   alphabets/scripts, searching will remain accent sensitive.

@version 0.01 *)

(** {1 Example} 
    
    For searching a substring in a list of strings, you only need two
    lines of code.  Here we use the [sample] list of names that can be
    found in the test directory.

First we prepare the data:
{[
# let items = Ufind.items_from_names sample;;
val items : string Ufind.search_item Seq.t = <fun>
]}

And then we may search:
{[
# let result = Ufind.select_data items "ap";;
val result : string list =
  ["Olivia Apodaca"; "Gi\195\161p \196\144\195\180ng Ngh\225\187\139"]
# List.iter print_endline result;;
Olivia Apodaca
Giáp Đông Nghị
- : unit = ()                 
]}

The string "Olivia Apodaca" came first, because the substring "ap" is
present without any accent substitution. If we searched "áp" instead,
the order of the results would have been inverted.

(** {1 Search filters}

The search can be greatly modified by playing with two filters: {e casefolding}
   and {e matching_defect}.

*)

(** {2 Casefolding}

 The [casefolding] parameter is the function used to perform a {b
   case-insensitive} search. Two strings that have the same image under this
   function will be considered equal (exact match).

    This function is applied only in the preprocess stage, see below.  *)

type casefolding =
  | CF_D144 (** {{:http://unicode.org/versions/latest/ch03.pdf}Unicode Core Spec}, page 157. *)
  | CF_D145 (** {{:http://unicode.org/versions/latest/ch03.pdf}Unicode Core Spec}, page 158. *)
  | CF_D147 (** {{:http://unicode.org/versions/latest/ch03.pdf}Unicode Core Spec}, page 158. *)
  | CF_NONE (** no transformation *)
  | CF_LATIN145 (** D145 restricted to Latin letters *)
  | CF_LATIN147 (** D147 restricted to Latin letters *)
  | CF_ASCII (** ASCII lowercase *)
  | CF_CUSTOM of (string -> string) (** any compatible function -- see below *)
(** For enforcing a {b case-sensitive} search, just use [CF_NONE]. The
   casefolding function can also be used to {e normalize} the utf8 string; this
   is done by [CF_D145] and [CF_D147].  However, recall that normalizing is a
   slow operation, and it should rather be done directly when storing items in
   your database. The expected properties of the casefolding function are:

    - Removing accents (with {!utf8_to_ascii}) followed by casefolding should
   give the same result as casefolding followed be removing accents. The
   resulting string is called the base string. It contains only ASCII
   characters.

    - Applying casefolding on a base string should return the unmodified string.

    - If two items have different base strings, they will never match in any
   search.

    - If two items have the same base string, they should match in any search,
   but maybe we a low ranking (low matching quality).

   Expected property for case-insensitive search:

    - Equality of casefolded ASCII strings should be equivalent to equality of
   the strings obtained by applying [String.lowercase_ascii].

    CUSTOM casefolding functions can be used for specific cases. For instance,
   one can use {!capitalize_casefold}, which combines a usual lower-case
   function with capitalizing the first letter. In this way we force the match
   to happen at the start of the string: "Ver" (or "ver") will match with
   "Véronique" and "VÉRONIQUE" but not with "Prévert" or "PRÉVERT". Of course,
   the same result can be obtained by a simple {!matching_defect} function, see
   below.  *)

val capitalize_casefold : string -> string
(* Standard UTF casefolding (D144) except for the first letter, which is
   capitalized. For most words, this will put everything in lowercase, except
   for the first letter in upper case. *)


(** {2 Matching defect}

Ufind uses a function that establishes the quality of "A being a substring of
   B". It is entirely parameterizable. It should be fast and {e not} deal with
   accents, only raw strings. *)

type matching_defect =
  | MD_EQUAL
  | MD_SUBSTRING
  | MD_CUSTOM of ((string * string) -> (string * string) -> int option)

(**

   - The default matching defect is [MD_SUBSTRING]. For this function, the
   defect increases with the position of the substring A within the string B, and
   with the difference between their respective sizes.

   - [MD_EQUAL] only accepts strict equality of strings. Equal strings have
   zero defect, and non-equal strings have undefined defect.

   - [MD_CUSTOM f] will compute the defect with the function [f], which takes
   two arguments, each one of the form [(name, base)], where [name] is a utf8
   string, and [base] its ASCII version. The function [f] should have the
   following properties:

      [f s1 s2] returns [None] if [s1] is not considered as a substring of [s2]
   (whatever you want it to mean); otherwise

      [f s1 s2] returns [Some d] where the non-negative integer [d] measures the
   defect of [s1] being "close" to [s2]. (The "best match" should return [d=0].)

      [f s1 s2] returns [Some 0] if [s1 = s2].

   A good matching_defect function should primarily compare the "name" components 
   of [s1] and [s2]; it does not need to take into account their "base" components. 
   However, it must be consistent in the following way:

      If [f (name1, base1) (name2, base2) <> None] then we must have 
      [f (base1, "") (base2, "") <> None] as well.

   {e In future versions, we plan to implement functions that accept small
   typing errors, like permutations of two consecutive letters. But right now,
   you need to write your own function for this feature.}  *)
  
(** {1 Searching}

The Ufind library is meant for searching through a database by filtering a
   string field, typically a name. We use the vocabulary "name" for denoting the
   field in question; but of course, it can be any string field, as long as it
   is UTF8 encoded.

*)

(** {2 Preparing the data}

Before searching, the data has to be preprocessed, in order to transform it into
   a sequence of {!search_item}s. The preprocess can be lazy (will be executed
   only when real search queries will be made), but if memory allows it, it will
   be much faster to preprocess the whole data in memory, especially if you
   intend to perform several searches in the same database.

A search item does not have to contain all the data of the original records, it
   only contains the "name" field and a "data" pointer to recover the original
   data.

*)

type 'a search_item

val base_of_item : 'a search_item -> string
(** Return the ASCII version of the item. *)

val data_of_item : 'a search_item -> 'a
(** Return the data associated with the item. *)

val preprocess : ?folding:casefolding ->
  ?limit:int * int ->
  get_name:('a -> string) ->
  get_data:('a -> 'b) -> 'a Seq.t -> 'b search_item Seq.t
(** [preprocess ~get_name ~get_data seq] returns a sequence of [search_item]s
   from the source sequence [seq].

   This function is a general way of obtaining a sequence of search items from
   any kind of data source, as long as this source can be accessed by a sequence
   (ocaml type [Seq.t]). The function [get_name] takes an element of the
   sequence and should return the name field that we are searching. The function
   [get_data] on an element of the sequence can return any type of data that we
   want to associate with the result of the search. It can be the same as
   [get_name]. But, the data can also be the id of the correspondng record, so
   that from the result of the search on the name field we can recover the other
   fields of the matching records.

   The {!preprocess} function is {e not} lazy; as a consequence, the resulting
   sequence is very fast to search. If [limit=(offset,count)], [preprocess] will
   force evaluation of the first [offset+count] elements of the sequence [seq],
   and return a sequence of at most [count] effectively computed [search_items]
   starting at item #[offset] (inclusive). Warning, if no [limit] is given, the
   whole [seq] is processed; hence if [seq] is infinite, it will never terminate
   until memory overflows.

    In all [preprocess*] functions, the returned sequence is not mutable, has no
   side-effect, and will always point to the start of the source sequence. So
   there is no need to reset it for each new search. *)

val preprocess_list : ?folding:casefolding ->
  get_name:('a -> string) ->
  get_data:('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b search_item Seq.t
(** Same as {!preprocess} but the database is a list instead of a sequence. *)

val preprocess_file : ?limit:int * int ->
  get_name:(string -> string) ->
  get_data:(string -> 'a) -> string -> 'a search_item Seq.t
(** Use this to search in a file, where each item must be encoded in a single
   line. The name field should be obtained by [get_name line], and the data
   field by [get_data line]. Returns the sequence of pre-processed search items.
   *) 

val items_from_seq : ?folding:casefolding ->
  get_name:('a -> string) ->
  get_data:('a -> 'b) -> 'a Seq.t -> 'b search_item Seq.t
(** Similar to {!preprocess} except that there is no preprocessing: this
   immediately returns a lazy sequence of items, suitable for searching.

    If the source sequence is mutable (most sequences are), then for each new
   search, it has to be reset to its origin position, and a new call to
   [items_from_seq] is required.

    If memory allows and if you intend to perform several searches, use
   {!preprocess} for faster searching. *)

val items_from_names : ?folding:casefolding ->
  string list -> string search_item Seq.t
(** [items_from_names list] immediately returns a lazy sequence of search items
   from a list of strings.

    The returned sequence is not mutable, and will always point to the start of
   the list. So there is no need to reset it for each new search.

   For faster searching, rather use [preprocess_list ~get_name:id ~get_data:id
   list], where [id x = x]. The only interest of [items_from_names] is when the
   list is really long and we don't want to duplicate it in memory. *)

val items_from_text : ?folding:casefolding -> string -> (int * string) search_item Seq.t
(** [items_from_text text] immediately constructs a lazy list of search_item
   corresponding to each word of the string [text], where word delimiters are 
    [[ \t\n()]]. Usual punctuation signs are removed from the end of words.

    The returned sequence is not mutable, and will always point to the start of
   the text. So there is no need to reset it for each new search.

    After searching with {!select_data}, the resulting data is a list of pairs
   [(pos, word)] where [pos] is the position of the word in the original string.
   *)

val items_from_channel : ?folding:casefolding -> in_channel -> (int * string) search_item Seq.t

(** [items_from_channel channel] immediately constructs a lazy list of
   search_item corresponding to each word read from the [channel], where word
   delimiters are [[ \t\n()]]. Usual punctuation signs are removed from the end
   of words.

    The resulting sequence is mutable, and will point to the current search
   position in the channel, which is not closed by this function.

 After searching with {!select_data}, the resulting data is a list of pairs
   [(pos, word)] where [pos] is the byte position of the word in channel,
   starting from the initial state of the channel.

  ?stop:('a search_item -> bool) ->
  ?matching_stop:(int * 'a search_item -> bool) ->

(** [select_data seq name] searches for the string [name] within the sequence of
   search items [seq] and returns the sorted list of data corresponding to
   matching items.

   If [stop] is not provided, the search will explore the whole
   sequence. Otherwise, the search will stop after processing the first [item]
   in [seq] for which [stop item = true]. The argument [matching_stop] operates
   in a similar way, but is executed only on matching items, and its argument is
   the couple [(distance, item)]. *)

val make_stop : ?count:int -> ?timeout:float -> unit -> 'a -> bool
(** [make_stop ~count ~timeout ()] creates a 'stop' function suitable for use
   in {!select_data}.

    It will stop after processing [count] elements, or when the [timeout] (in
   seconds) is elapsed. Note that the timer starts as soon at the unit argument
   [()] is provided. 

    The stop function has to be created again after each use.
