(* The casefolding parameter is the function used to perform a case-insensitive
   search. Two strings that have the same image under this function will be
   considered equal (exact match).

   For enforcing a case sensitive search, just use CF_NONE. The casefolding
   function can also be used to _normalize_ the utf8 string; however, recall
   that normalizing is a slow operation, and it should rather be done directly
   when storing items in your database. The expected properties of the
   casefolding function are:

   1. Removing accents (with Ubase) followed by casefolding should give the same
   result as casefolding followed be removing accents. The resulting string is
   called the base string. It contains only ASCII characters.

   2. Applying casefoldind on a base string should return the unmodified string.

   3. If two items have different base strings, they will never match in any
   search.

   4. If two items have the same base string, they should match in any search,
   but maybe we a low ranking (low matching quality).

   Expected property for case-insensitive search:

   5. Equality of casefolded ASCII strings should be equivalent to equality of
   the strings obtained by applying [String.lowercase_ascii].

   CUSTOM casefolding functions can be used for specific cases. For instance, a
   useful one is to combining a usual lower-case function with capitalizing the
   first letter. In this way, "Ver" (or "ver") will match with "Véronique" and
   "VÉRONIQUE" but not with "Prévert" or "PRÉVERT".

let seq = list_to_seq ["1";"2";"3";"4";"5"];;
let seq_test = Seq.map (fun s -> print_endline ("Reading: " ^s); s) seq;;

For instance we can check that seq_truncate evaluates only "start" elements:
# let s1 = seq_truncate 1 2 seq_test;;
Reading: 1
val s1 : string Seq.t = <fun>
# Seq.iter print_endline s1;;
Reading: 2
2
Reading: 3
3
- : unit = ()
# 

   We now chek the funny behaviour of seq_split:

# let s1,s2 = seq_split seq_test;;
val s1 : string Seq.t = <fun>
val s2 : unit -> string Seq.node = <fun>

The rule is "s2 always start just after the last execution of s1":

# Seq.iter print_endline s2;;
Reading: 1
1
Reading: 2
2
Reading: 3
3
Reading: 4

# Seq.iter print_endline s2;;

   Now with truncation of s1:

#  let s1t = seq_truncate 1 2 s1;;
Reading: 1
val s1t : string Seq.t = <fun>
# Seq.iter print_endline s1t;;

# let stop = make_stop ~count:2 ();;
